        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Christian!</h2>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Professional from the Bay Area. I began taking a Cyber Security Bootcamp in early 2023 but I was always interested in the cyber world. I started this blog to immerse myself further by speaking and researching topics that I'm interested in. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy!

                <h3>John the Ripper</h3>
                <h4>John the Ripper, Password Cracker</h4>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">When I first became interested in the cyber world I knew that there were many dark sides of the web. We already know not to click on suspicious links and to be wary of what sites we visit but when I first joined my Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I never knew how "easy" it could be to have your passwords be cracked. We learned about a tool called "John the Ripper." It is a modern password cracking software that takes a list of hashes as input, hashes passwords from a given password list, and compares each hash to the list of hashes it was given, and if it matches a hash, it gives outputs of what password was used to create the hash.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I was shocked at how it all worked. For an activity, we had to download a file called "rockyou.txt." "Rockyou.txt" is a widely known password wordlist that was created after a data breach at the social networking platform RockYou, where hackers stole and published more than 32 million user passwords. After using that file in the activity, we were able to crack the hashes we were given. My group for that activity all agreed that it was insane how easy that portion of the activity was and that in the wrong hands, it could spell doom. If you think back to the RockYou leak...32 million user passwords.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The weekend after that class, I had dinner with a few friends and they asked me how my bootcamp was going. I told them about that week and all the ways we learned to protect ourselves to the best we can with our password setup. Suggestions like, using song lyrics instead of just one or two words, some numbers, and a few special characters. Most of them told me that their company IT guys gave them those same suggestions too, which made me happy to know that when it comes to my friends jobs, they are aware to ways they can protect themselves from leaks, phishing, and things of that nature. That lasted until one of my friends said, "But it's just too hard to remember all these passwords!" We all just stared for a few moments, then we burst out laughing.

                <h3>Phishing</h3>
                <h4>Phishing, Training</h4>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">A few years ago I worked at a dealership and upon signing on to work there I had to do some online training before my start date. It didn't seem like a big deal; spend some time learning more about the company I was working for, learned about the vehicles, and one thing that caught my eye was a training on something called, "Phishing." At that time, that was the first I ever heard of that term. I took notice. I mean, you see a word you've never heard of before, you look it up, and end up falling through a rabbit hole of information. I was always a cautious person when it came to my email, texts, and phone calls. If I don't recognize the contact, I'm not responding. If it's from a company I've never purchased anything from or heard of before, I'm not gonna open up that email. I never knew there was an actual term for those types of emails. I was surprised because I learned about it through a work training and seeing as where I'm trying to take my career, it's good to know that companies offer the knowledge and it's up to that person to take it to heart.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">After working at that dealership, I became a delivery driver for a battery company. Same thing as the previous employeer, I got training on phishing again. This time the training was every 6 months, and you actually had to have a test at the end of the training to get a certificate of completion. Hearing my co-workers at the time complaining about the training because they never really open up their emails but I still felt that it was needed. Even if you're not opening up emails from work doesn't mean you're not opening up emails for your own personal use.</p> 
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I honestly feel that when companies offer the trainings for these types of things it is up to the user to want to pay attention or not. That one training made me aware of things I didn't even know existed. I feel that if it's framed as a typical training it might not be for everyone but if you could offer a more immersive experience like some of the training I've experienced, I think we'd all be better off. I've seen skits where you have to watch through to figure out the outcome, and yes it may be corny but I still think that behind all of that is so much useful knowledge to everyone.</p>
