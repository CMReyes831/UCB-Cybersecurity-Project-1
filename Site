                <h3>John the Ripper</h3>
                <h4>John the Ripper, Password Cracker</h4>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">When I first became interested in the cyber world I knew that there were many dark sides of the web. We already know not to click on suspicious links and to be wary of what sites we visit but when I first joined my Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I never knew how "easy" it could be to have your passwords be cracked. We learned about a tool called "John the Ripper." It is a modern password cracking software that takes a list of hashes as input, hashes passwords from a given password list, and compares each hash to the list of hashes it was given, and if it matches a hash, it gives outputs of what password was used to create the hash.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I was shocked at how it all worked. For an activity, we had to download a file called "rockyou.txt." "Rockyou.txt" is a widely known password wordlist that was created after a data breach at the social networking platform RockYou, where hackers stole and published more than 32 million user passwords. After using that file in the activity, we were able to crack the hashes we were given. My group for that activity all agreed that it was insane how easy that portion of the activity was and that in the wrong hands, it could spell doom. If you think back to the RockYou leak...32 million user passwords.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The weekend after that class, I had dinner with a few friends and they asked me how my bootcamp was going. I told them about that week and all the ways we learned to protect ourselves to the best we can with our password setup. Suggestions like, using song lyrics instead of just one or two words, some numbers, and a few special characters. Most of them told me that their company IT guys gave them those same suggestions too, which made me happy to know that when it comes to my friends jobs, they are aware to ways they can protect themselves from leaks, phishing, and things of that nature. That lasted until one of my friends said, "But it's just too hard to remember all these passwords!" We all just stared for a few moments, then we burst out laughing.
